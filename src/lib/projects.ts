            "The material palette was deliberately limited to create a minimal, but tonal and warm interior. A beige concrete floor was used to reflect the hues in the brick and oak, extending into the garden. This was complemented by a handmade oak kitchen, finished with a light whitewash to bring the tones together.",

            "An oak timber portal signifies the junction of the existing and new, angled to match the roof light rafters. The wide opening allows for long site lines through the property, allowing the clients to appreciate the changing shadows as they cast on the extension walls.",

            "The bathroom uses light tones and lime wash paint to create a refined and calm bathroom."
